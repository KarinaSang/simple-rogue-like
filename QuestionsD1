1. How could you design your system so that each race could be easily generated? 
Additionally, how difficult does such a solution make adding additional classes?
- We can employ the map structure in c++ and create a map <char, vector <int> info> m, 
so when user enters a letter representing the race, we search through m to find the
vector of integers that matches the letter from user input. We then construct a
player object that contains three integer fields: hp, atk, and def, and their values will
be initialized to info[0], info[1], and info[2] accordingly. Using this approach, if we
were to add additional classes, we can just push another <char, vector <int> info> pair
to m without modifying other parts of the code.

2. How does your system handle generating different enemies? Is it different from 
how you generate the player character? Why or why not?
- using map<string, enemyObject>

3. How could you implement special abilities for different enemies. 
For example, gold stealing for goblins, health regeneration for trolls, 
health stealing for vampires, etc.?
- have a function called *specialAbility*, and override the function in each enemy class

4. What design pattern could you use to model the effects of temporary potions(Would/Boost/Atk/Def) 
so that you do not need to explicitly track which potions the player character has consumed on 
any particular floor?
- visitor?

5. How could you generate items so that the generation of Treasure, Potions, and major items reuses 
as much code as possible? That is for example, how would you structure your system so that the generation
of a potion and then generation of treasure does not duplicate code? How could you resuse the code used
to protect both dragon hoards and the Barrier Suit?
